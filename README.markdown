# Base

This is my base template for HTML projects. To compile SCSS and CoffeeScript, you need to install Rake, Compass, and CoffeeScript.

    npm install -g coffee-script
    gem install rake compass

To compile the files, run the Rake script.

    rake compile
    rake watch:scss
    rake watch:coffee
